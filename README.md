# AAPP-Projects
These projects are part of the Advanced Alghorithms and Parallel Programming course at Polytechnic University of Milan. The project is of the academic year 2022/2023.

# Advanced Alghorithm project specification
The AA-project aims to develop an alghorithm that, given the number of rows and columns, creates a random maze in which the start is in the upper left cell and the finish in the bottom right one. The project had to be done with less time and spatial complexity possible.

# Parallel Programming project specification
The PP-project aims to develop a program that performs the grep function in parallel with MPI and that works with different number of processes. The alghorithm takes as input the text file, the string to search and the number of processes to run in parallel and gives as output the number of match found. The project had to be done optimizing the executing time. Furthermore, we had to provide some considerations about the normal grep function and the one created.

# Tools
- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - to run the code
- [C++] - to write the code
- [MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) - for the parallel programming part
